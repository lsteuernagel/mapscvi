\title{Propagates cell labels base don provided vector using the nearest neighbors in the reference.}
\usage{
propagate_labels_prob(
  neighbors_object = NULL,
  label_vec,
  query_seurat_object = NULL,
  reference_seurat_object = NULL,
  reduction_name_query = "scvi",
  reduction_name_reference = "scvi",
  annoy.metric = "cosine",
  k.param = 30,
  with_euclidean = FALSE,
  result_type = "label",
  add_entropy = FALSE,
  add_to_seurat = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{neighbors_object}{neighbors-object with reference neighbors of query (see SeuratObject). If NULL will run neighbor detection between query_seurat_object and reference_seurat_object. Requires slot nn.idx and nn.dist.}

\item{label_vec}{vector with labels}

\item{query_seurat_object}{seurat with query data (and a reduction that is projected from reference_seurat_object) to find shared neighbors. NULL by default (not used when neighbors_object is provided)}

\item{reference_seurat_object}{seurat to map onto. NULL by default (not used when neighbors_object is provided)}

\item{reduction_name_query}{name of reduction in query (not used when neighbors_object is provided)}

\item{reduction_name_reference}{name of reduction in reference (not used when neighbors_object is provided)}

\item{annoy.metric}{euclidean or cosine (not used when neighbors_object is provided)}

\item{k.param}{k param for neighbor finding (not used when neighbors_object is provided)}

\item{with_euclidean}{Apply gaussian kernel to smooth distances .only use when distance = euclidean ! (or a neighbors_object based on euclidean distances is provided)}

\item{result_type}{"all","label" or "entropy". All means all probabilities of cell types in neighborhood. For label the maximum is taken to return the likeliest assignment. All returns all results (multiple colummns!), entropy calculates the entropy across probabilities as an uncertainty measure but does not return a label}

\item{add_entropy}{re-run to calculate entropy as uncertainty measure}

\item{add_to_seurat}{add to query_seurat_object or return dataframe, requires query_seurat_object to be provided}

\value{
seuratobject or dataframe with label propagation results and qc
